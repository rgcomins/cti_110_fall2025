matplot_cube.txt

Prompt: "Take this existing Python program
that draws a square and a triangle, and 
create a version that displays in 3D using 
a cube an a pyramid."

AI suggested matplotlib, so we went with that.

Originally, the pyramid was too small, so
changed line 36:
pyramid_base_side (as the original value didn't 
reach far enough)

Reflection:

Was the code correct and complete? Yes,
other than the change mentioned.

What parts did you have to fix? We made the
change to the pyramid size

How would you rephrase for better results?
Not sure. (Probably knowing about matplotlib
beforehand, would have mentioned it.)

What are the benefits and risks of AI coding?
Program was complete in a matter of minutes rather than an hour or so.
actual dimensions of the pyramid had to be adjusted to fit the program.
