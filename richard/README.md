## Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET, POST | Landing page with hotel welcome |
| `/rooms` | GET | Room gallery and booking form |
| `/trip_summary` | POST | Calculate and display trip costs |
| `/submit` | POST | Legacy form handler |

## Room Pricing

| Room Type | Nightly Rate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Deluxe Ocean Front | $395 |
| Ilima Ocean West | $345 |
| Ocean View | $295 |
| Partial Ocean View | $219 |

## How It Works

1. **Home Page** - User sees welcome message with Hawaii background
2. **Room Selection** - User views room images and fills out booking form
3. **Form Submission** - JavaScript sends email via EmailJS, then POSTs to Flask
4. **Trip Summary** - Flask calculates all costs and renders summary:
   - Room cost = nights × nightly rate
   - Activity cost = sum of selected activities
   - Subtotal = room + tickets + activities
   - Tax = 10.25% of subtotal
   - **Total = subtotal + tax**

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - Programming language
- **Flask** - Web framework
- **Jinja2** - Template engine
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Frontend markup and styling
- **JavaScript** - Client-side interactivity
- **EmailJS** - Email delivery service

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- Flask routing and view functions
- HTML form creation and processing
- Jinja2 template rendering with variables
- Python datetime calculations
- Client-side JavaScript integration
- Third-party API integration (EmailJS)
- CSS inline styling techniques

## Documentation

- [Product Requirements Document](Product_Requirements_Doc.md) - Detailed specifications
- [Setup Guide](SETUP.md) - Installation and configuration instructions

## Troubleshooting

### VS Code Python Interpreter Issues
If Flask stops working in VS Code:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Command Palette)
2. Type "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose the global Python installation

### Common Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Module not found | Run `pip install flask` |
| Port already in use | Kill other Flask instances or use `flask run -p 5001` |
| Template not found | Ensure you're running from the `richard/` directory |
